# Asher's Minecraft Banner Helper

For Minecrafters who like to make banners, this simple tool helps to generate `/give` commands.

You can access the page [here](https://ashervahalik.github.io/minecraft-banner-helper).

### Lookup

In Minecraft, the patterns used to make a loom have names. Often, these are confusing for people to remember, so there is a dropdown chart at the top displaying the pattern name with the asset ID, which describes the pattern's shape. For example, "lozenge" translates to "rhombus."

### Create

This feature is the star of the show. To get started, you just need to put in the base color for the banner, and click the set button. Then, you input the pattern name (*not* the asset ID), and the desired color for that pattern, then click "Add Pattern." Once you've added your desired patterns, click "Finish" and a command will be generated. If the command is too long to run in the chat, you'll see a little notice pop up at the bottom, in which case you'll need to use a command block.

Because this utility is just HTML and JavaScript, and because it is entirely self-contained, it will work offline if you download it.
